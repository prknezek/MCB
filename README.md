# MCB
MCB (My Chess Bot) is my first attempt at creating a chess bot in C++ using up-to-date algorithms. This bot uses a 0x88 board representation. More details about 0x88 boards can be found here: <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/0x88">0x88 Board Representation</a>.

Inspired by the "0x88 MOVE GENERATOR (Wukong)" tutorial series made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chessprogramming591">Chess Programming</a>.

The bot currently has an estimated ELO of 1830

Algorithms & Techniques:
- PeSTO evaluation
- Zobrist hashing
- Principle Variation (PV) moves
- Null move pruning
- Killer and history heuristics
- Quiescence search
- Tapered evaluation
- Transposition tables.
