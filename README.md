# MCB
MCB (My Chess Bot) is my first attempt at creating a chess bot in C++ using up-to-date algorithms. This bot uses a 0x88 board representation. More details about 0x88 boards can be found here: <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/0x88">0x88 Board Representation</a>.

This bot follows the "0x88 MOVE GENERATOR (Wukong)" tutorial series made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chessprogramming591">Chess Programming</a>.

Since 10/18/2023 the tutorial has been completed.
